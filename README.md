CS Fight Club
===========================

This is a strategy based card when where users can login and battle against people connected to the server.

To run this game, make sure the server is running (See below)

After server is running, make sure VPN is set up to send all traffic through the CS, so that you can access the database of cards

After ensuring both of these steps, run the CSFightClub.jar file and simply play

===========================

To run the server simply run the Server.jar file from the terminal and provide a port that it can listen to as one of the arguments

============================

Current bugs:

 - Single player mode sometimes does not run and locks the whole GUI therefore the whole application has to be quit

 - Clicking match more than once in lobby will mean that server will fail and needs to be restarted
