*** '-' means we don't care about the value ***

For the most part, using Cards is simple, there are getters and setters for the attack and the damage of minions, getters for cost, ...

The difficulty comes in the use of the effects.
There is a string, effect, which just stores the effect as it would be displayed on the card.
The effect has also been split up logically, stored in public fields.

Every effect is stored in the form:
EFFECTS: (ACTION QUANTITY/(ATTACKGAIN/HEALTHGAIN) WHO WHEN) AND/OR (ACTION QUANTITY/(ATTACKGAIN/HEALTHGAIN) WHO WHEN)

First we look at what is stored in the field ACTIONS, which is a single int.
ACTIONS_SINGLE tells us there is no AND or OR, so we only have to consider the first int in every pair.
ACTIONS_AND and ACTIONS_OR tells us there is two possible effects.

Every other field is stored as an Intpair (set originally at -1,-1), where the first element in each pair is for the first effect, 
the second is for the second effect. The methods public int getFirst() and public int getSecond() exist for Intpair.

e.g.

"Restore 3 health to character and draw a card" is equivalent to (read vertically down each column):

ACTION =   (ACTION_RESTORE, ACTION_DRAW)
QUANTITY = (3             , -1         )
WHO =      (WHO_CHARACTER , WHO_NULL   )
WHEN =     (WHEN_NULL     , WHEN_NULL  )

For all possible enumerations for every category, see the Card class, where comments added.

Where we have null entries in otherwise populated fields, it is up to you to decide what the default would be,
e.g. where ACTION = (ACTION_DAMAGE, -), WHO = (WHO_NULL, -), WHEN = (WHEN_NULL, -) we would assume the damage will be applied 
directly to the opponent's face, immediately, by the quantity given.

The only exception to this methodology is the use of ACTION_GAIN, e.g. Gain +3/+2 for a minion on this turn
Here we have two quantities
Rather than using QUANTITY we use ATTACKGAIN and HEALTHGAIN, so this would translate to:

ACTIONS = ACTIONS_SINGLE
EFFECT = (EFFECT_NULL, -)
ACTION = (ACTION_GAIN, -)
ATTACKGAIN = (3, -)
HEALTHGAIN = (2, -)
WHO = (WHO_MINION, -)
WHEN = (WHEN_THISTURN, -)

***Intpair EFFECT, before the colon, are the key words that some card use, e.g. Block, Deadline, Rush***

To make use of these enumerations, it should be a lot of switch-case and if-statements to work out the overall effect when the card 
is played.
